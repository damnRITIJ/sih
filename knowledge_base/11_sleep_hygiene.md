## 🛏️ Optimizing Your Sleep Environment
- Keep your bedroom **cool, dark, and quiet**. The ideal temperature is between 16-19°C (60-67°F).
- Ensure your mattress and pillows are comfortable and reserve the bed **for sleep and intimacy only**.

## 🕰️ Building a Consistent Routine
- **Stick to a consistent schedule** by going to bed and waking up at the same time daily, even on weekends.
- Create a **relaxing wind-down ritual** for 30-60 minutes before bed, like reading a book or gentle stretching.
- **Avoid screens for at least one hour** before bed, as blue light suppresses the sleep hormone melatonin.

## ☀️ Daily Habits That Affect Sleep
