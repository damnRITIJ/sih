# A Guide to Digital Wellbeing and Social Media
Digital wellbeing is about creating a healthy, intentional relationship with technology that supports your overall well-being rather than detracting from it.


## ‚ö†Ô∏è The Impact of Technology
- **The Comparison Trap**: Social media's "highlight reel" can cause feelings of inadequacy and anxiety.

- **Fragmented Attention**: Constant notifications make deep focus difficult and train our brains to be distracted.

- **Disrupted Sleep**: Blue light from screens interferes with melatonin production, impacting sleep quality.


## üí° Practical Steps for a Healthier Tech Relationship
- Curate your feed by unfollowing accounts that make you feel bad.

- Set app timers and limits using your phone's built-in tools.

- Turn off non-essential notifications to take back control of your attention.

- Create tech-free zones (like the bedroom) or times (like the first hour of the day).

- Be an intentional user by asking "Why?" before you pick up your phone.
