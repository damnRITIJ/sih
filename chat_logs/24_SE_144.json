There's no pressure to share anything you're not comfortable with, but talking about it might help.  Just knowing you're not alone can make a difference."

    "user": "what is my name",
    "bot": "Your name is Ritij Raj.  Remember, it's okay to feel sad.  And it's even okay not to know exactly *why* you're feeling sad right now.  Just knowing you're feeling this way is a good first step.  Is there anything you'd like to talk about that might help us understand what's going on a little better?"
