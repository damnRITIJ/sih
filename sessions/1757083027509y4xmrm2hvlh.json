    "Bot: Oh my gosh, I'm so incredibly sorry to hear that.  That sounds incredibly difficult, and I want you to know you're not alone.  Please know that reaching out is a huge step, and it takes a lot of courage to share this.  It\u2019s okay to not be okay.  Is there anything at all you'd like to talk about right now?  Even if it's just something small, it might help to get it off your chest.  Or, if you'd rather just sit in silence for a bit, that's okay too.  I'm here to listen without judgment.  Most importantly, please know that there are people who want to help, and you don't have to go through this by yourself.  Would you like me to help you find some resources that can provide immediate support?",
